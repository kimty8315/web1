    medical device consisting of Absorbable Modified Polymers (AMP®) and a unique powder delivery system (applicator).
    It is a safe and effective method to control bleeding in both upper and lower GI tracts. It works particularly well
    for large, oozing to moderate bleeding wounds, such as ulcer bleeding, tumor bleeding and EMR/ESD.
    It is capable of being applied to lesions that may be located in hard to reach areas. It is also useful to prevent
    re-bleeding post EMR/ESD and can be used as an add-on therapy to control bleeding with any other conventional techniques.
